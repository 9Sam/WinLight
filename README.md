# About this project

The purpose of this project is to simulate the spotlight functionality of mac OS in windows using AutoHotkey to achieve this. The main functionality is to execute commands from an input file, these commands are locally stored in a JSON file and the program will execute the command if this exists.\

# Installation

First of all, you must install AutoHotkey by downloading the exe file from its website [autohotkey.com](https://www.autohotkey.com)

To install this project on your computer just download the containing folder and execute the **WinLight.ahk** file within the folder, alternatively you could make a shortcut file and save it in the start folder of windows so it will be loaded on the next start of the system.

> Open the startup forlder by pressing the `Windows + R` keys on your keyboard.

# Create commands

## Commands file

Remove the ***"x"*** letter from the end of the name of the **commands.json** file.

## Command structure

**command**: The property is used to declare the word or succession of letters used to represent the command
**alias**: It is used as a richer representation of the command property, it must be considered as a short description of the command property, the length of the **alias** property shouldn't be so long or it could lead to a bad visual representation. Four (4) words max will be fine.

## Create a command to open files

```json
{
    "command": "<commandCharacteres>",
    "alias": "<commandNameRepresentation>",
    "commandType": "run",
    "sound": "false",
    "action": "S:\\SAM\\ProgramaciÃ³n\\Autohotkey\\scripts\\bots\\WinLight\\commands.json",
    "type":"ðŸ“„ File"
},
```
